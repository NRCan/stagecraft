# JSON schema

There are JSON files in this repository that are validated against a schema.

* Modules will be validated against the schema in `./modules` corresponding to their module type.
* Files do not need to be `.json` files. `.js` files that export an object will also work (this is useful if you want to include other schema as child nodes of existing schema).
